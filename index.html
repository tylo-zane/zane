        <p>
          Anxiety is a common problem. Over 19.1 percent of adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with an 
          anxiety disorder. When improperly designed for, this audience can be easily deterred from 
          following through with a service or product 
          <a class="ref" href="https://level-level.com/blog/inclusive-design-designing-for-people-with-anxiety/">(Leber, 2020)</a>.

        <h2 class="small-header">Research</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Research was conducted by collecting as many interface design guidelines for the purpose 
            of reducing anxiety as possible. This data was gathered across the web 
            from the studies and articles of 
            design professionals who specialize in inclusive design.
          </p>
          <h3>Categorizing the Data</h3>
          <p>
            Once all data was collected, 
            each guideline was tagged with a broad category. The frequency of each category was used
            to divide all guidelines into the following four categories:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Flow</p></li>
            <li><p>Forms</p></li>

        <div>
          <p>Google’s business model relies on collecting user data in order to ‘personalize’ ads.
            However, several issues arise from Google’s methods of data collection, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Excessive colletion of personal data</p></li>
            <li><p>Deceptive management options of what gets collected</p></li>

          <p>The Google Activity Manager app is a renovated platform to manage the personal data

          <h3>Excessive Data Collection</h3>
          <p>The sheer amount of personal data that Google collects is overwhelming.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Researchers found that an Android phone which was inactive for 24 hours sent 900 
                  data samples to Google. Over ⅓ of the samples contained location data 
                  <a class="ref" href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/google-is-collecting-your-data-even-when-your-phone-isnt-in-use/">(Sutton, 2018)</a>
            </p></li>
            <li><p>An Android phone in airplane mode was found to have collected 
                  over 100 location markers in the course of the user’s day, each of these markers 
                  containing an accurate description of the user’s actions at the time (Getting out 
                  of a car, running, etcetera)

          </ul>
          <h3>Deceptive Data Management</h3>
          <p>The current version of Google’s “My Activity” creates a disconnect between what users expect buttons
            to do and what the buttons actually do. Ultimately, this forfeits the user’s feeling of being in-control.</p>
